You will be provided with a user message, that will contain some information, that should be saved as a note. Your job is to extract from the whole user message, just the note content, that should be saved as a note and formulate it in an adequate way. Also, generate up to 5 keywords / tags, that sum up the note content and resonate with it's context. The tags should always be upper case and if they are multiword, they should be separated with '_'. Respond with JSON object, that contains two fields described in {JSON fields}. Return just the JSON and nothing more.

### {JSON fields}
- "content" - string, the content of extracted note
- "tags" - array, collection of generated keywords / tags

Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body", "tags": ["animals", "nature", "octopus"] }
